# Analyzing a Geospatial Airport Database using PostgreSQL and PostGIS

# Project Description:

It involves working with spatial data and utilizing the access methods query executions and optimizations. This project would include writing SQL queries to retrieve information such as the locations of specific features, distances between points, and areas of interest, using indexing, aggregate and join executors, sort+ limit executors, sorting, and top-N optimization.

# Project Summary:

This project has been a significant exploration into the world of geospatial databases using PostgreSQL and its PostGIS extension. We sourced comprehensive airport data from OurAirports and successfully integrated this extensive dataset into our database. This allowed us to perform various queries, calculations, and analyses on the data, exploring the capabilities of PostGIS extension and learning how to use SQL for geospatial analysis.

By creating indexes and implementing N-Optimization techniques, we were able to optimize our queries, leading to faster and more efficient data retrieval. We gained practical insights into handling and optimizing large datasets, and understanding the balance between query performance and the computational cost of maintaining indexes.

However, This project only scratches the surface of what's possible with geospatial databases. There's a plethora of analyses and operations that can be conducted on this data, such as pathfinding, spatial joins, spatial clustering, and much more.
